# CPG-Control-Methods-simulation
Comparison of three CPG Control Methods (sinusoidal, hopf and matsuoka oscillators) for Rhythmic Motion in Lower-Body Exoskeletons 
This includes MATLAB scripts for 3D simulation and Arduino scripts for controlling a small pinned model with servo motors, implementing each of the CPG control methods
